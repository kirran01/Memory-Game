Hello Devs :)

This is my implementation of the classic card-matching memory game. Simply press start game to begin. Upon starting, all cards will be flipped for 3 seconds, revealing the picture underneath the card. After 3 seconds the cards will be flipped back, and the images will dissapear. After the cards are flipped back, its up to you to find the pairs among the flipped cards. Simply click a card to flip it, and click another to attempt to find its pair. 

This app is deployed on Netlify @ https://memory-game-kk.netlify.app/
